This project aims to classify quotes as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

# Approach
- Text preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Logistic Regression classifier

# Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

# Status
Project setup completed. Model training in progress.
